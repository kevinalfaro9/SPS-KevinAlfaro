      <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
 
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>Hello, my name is Kevin Alfaro and this is my portfolio!
         I currently am attending the University of Washington. I am a junior 
         majoring in Electrical & Computer Engineering. 
         I am Mexican-American and the first person in my family to go to college. I believe
         that good things come to those that work for them.
      </p>
      <h3>List of Projects</h3>
      <li>Blueberry: This app was developed during my 7-week internship at Microsoft through 
          the new Technologist Program in 2019. My team and I used Xcode/Swift in order develop the 
          app. Essentially, the app was created to help procrastinators input their schedule 
          along with upcoming tasks and we would use a sorting algorithm on the backend to
          prioritize the tasks that were most important and or due the soonest.
      </li>
      <li>UniWire: UniWire was developed this past summer as a returning New Technologist
          intern with Microsoft. This time, my team and I implemented a web application using:
          React, HTML & CSS. The purpose of the web application was to connect college students
          who attend the same school in order for them to collaborate on whatever projects or ideas
          they had in mind. A user on the site could create a project or join an ongoing project
          they were interested in it. I was able to experience with project management, MVP, Agile, 
          product life-cycle process and working with the HTML, CSS, and ReactJS.

        Attached above is my Image Gallery. The first one is not my dog, he is my roomates 
        dog but I have came to really appreciate him and love him a lot. His name is Lucky!
        The picture of water you see is when I went to hawaii in 2019, back when things 
        were normal. It was overall a very fun experience as I had gone with friends.
        Lastly, I went ahead and just a random picture of me from my computer. I used to 
        have a macbook with much better camera quality however I had to get a windows since 
        some classes have programs I need to run that run better on windows which is unfortunate!
